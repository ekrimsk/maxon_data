# Maxon Motor Web Scrapping 
This code helps facilitate brute force motor selection it is written in separate matlab and python files which I have strung togther 

This code was most recently run in August 2019, the maxon catalogue may have changed.


## Explanation of files/folders (in the order they should be run)
   The files ``` get_motor_pages.m``` and ``` get_gearbox_pages.m``` collect lists of motor and gearboxes the main selection tool on the maxon website through curl requests. 
     The files ``` get_maxon_motor.m``` and ``` get_maxon_gear.m``` get the actual data for the corresponding motors and gearboxes from the lists generated by the previous scripts. 
The file ``` motor_gb_combos.py``` automates a chrome  browser to find compataible motors and gearboxes. The scripts ```combine_gb_pages.m``` and ```fix_combos.m``` should be run after this.
